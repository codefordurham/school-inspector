Status
---------------
* **Phase 1**: Complete - Answer the question: How does zoning and location affect my school choices - across neighborhood, magnet and charter options?
* **Phase 2**: Complete - School profiles data collection and integration. We focussed on gathering key data points (e.g. principal info, score improvement rates, teacher/student ratios, etc) that parents said they want to know about schools (through a survey n=80) that will help them choose a school path. See latest details on progress by looking at our project page (http://codefordurham.com/projects/school_navigator)
* **Phase 3**: (In Progress) - Improve the user interface for School Profiles & add some relevant state-collected school data.
